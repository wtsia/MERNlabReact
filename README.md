# MERN Lab

Get ready to build your first MERN app! For this lab, your goal is to build a
simple MERN app with React on the front-end and Express on the back-end (optional). Your
app should have one and only one model if you choose to build a back-end!

**For this lab, please spend the bulk of your time on building the front-end/React first, 
moving on to the back-end only if you have time. This is a good opportunity to review and revisit 
concepts we've learned so far in React and apply them to a mini-project.** 

**We will have each group present their work at 5pm ET today - don't worry about having a 
complete project to present by then! We just want to see your progress. Please keep your
presentation to less than 3 minutes.**

**This is an open-ended, pair lab!**


## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

Pair programming is a common industry practice where two developers work on the same project together. Typically, one person is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". Throughout the lab you must switch roles.

Here are two explanations of pair-programming, it's benefits and how to do it:
1. [Pair Programming Considered Extremely Beneficial](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial)
2. [Agile Best Practices: Pair Programming](https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-software-programming-best-practices/pair-programming/)

## Prerequisites

- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods
- React Router
- Mongo, Mongoose, Express and Node

## Instructions

1.  Create 2 separate repos for your front-end and back-end code.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

**_DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY_**

Create the repos. Complete the requirements below and post
an issue on this repository linking to the relevant front-end and back-end repo(s) under your GitHub
account. 

For this lab, you may pair up with one other person. Since we haven't yet
covered git workflows, you'll have to research the `git branch`, `git checkout`,
and `git merge` commands and how to use them together. The
[Atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) site is a
great starting point, particularly the
[Feature Branch Workflow Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Requirements

Build a simple MERN app! 

Your app should have a front-end built with React.

**OPTIONAL**:Build a back-end with Express that persists 
data to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Your Express app should return JSON data to
your React front-end. Use AJAX to get data from your Express back-end and pass the data through your app using
state and props. Use React Router to build out separate 'views' for creating,
editing, updating and deleting instances of your model. Stick to just 1 model and 
keep it simple. 

## Bonus

Add another model as a sub-document. Finish full CRUD on your first model before
adding a subdocument. Make it so users can perform full CRUD on the
sub-document.

## Double Bonus

Deploy your app. Use heroku for the backend and surge for the frontend.
